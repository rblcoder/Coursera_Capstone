Business Problem:

A friend wants to check which neighborhoods in Toronto would be ideal to open an Italian Restaurant. 
The restaurant would ideally be in an area which already has some presence of Italian Restaurants so that opening a new one is not risky.
Target Audience:
1. This can be useful for people who want to analyze areas and businesses in an area to check if it is practical to open a business in an area.
 
Data:

Foursquare will be used as a source to obtain the data for finding neighborhoods which are similar and have Italian restaurants already.
The features that can be extracted from the Foursquare data are Venue Category which in turn can give us the count of each Venue Category in a neighborhood.
For a given location, Foursquare gives us existing Venues and the Category of Venues near the location for a given radius.
Given a business, one can explore the number of similar venues in each locality in comparison to the number of other venues to see if it practical to open one more such Venue.
